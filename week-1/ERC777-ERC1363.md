### What problems ERC777 and ERC1363 solves?

* Solves ERC20 bad UX of double call (approve/transferFrom) to send tokens to a contract as it allows sending and notifying a contract in a single transaction.
* Lack of immediate contract response on receiving a token as it introduces callback feature to allow contracts to react to token transfers
* Issue of stuck tokens, by introducing a receiver interface it ensures that will it only be sent to contracts that can handle the token

### Why was ERC1363 introduced?

To improve on ERC20, its less complex than ERC777. The `transfer` acts like normal ERC20 transfer and `transferAndCall` will do the transfer and call the receiver (NOTE: re-entracy attack possibility). The naming is more explicit and clearly conveys the actions that will be taken

### What issues are there with ERC777?

With the hooks introduced in ERC777, tokens are now also subjected to the possibility of re-entrancy attacks
